# Building Bharat â€” Next.js + Tailwind starter

This repository is a minimal scaffold to start converting your Figma prototype into a working site using Next.js (JavaScript) and Tailwind CSS.

What I added:
- Minimal Next.js app (pages-based) in JavaScript
- Tailwind + PostCSS configuration
- Starter components: `Header` and a home page with hero, features grid, and subscribe form

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd /home/navgurukul/Desktop/Building-Bharat
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

Next steps I can take (pick any):
- Implement additional pages from the Figma prototype (please indicate which screens to prioritize)
- Extract colors/typography tokens and produce a theme file
- Export assets (SVG/PNG) and wire them into the project
- Create responsive breakpoints and more components (cards, modals, forms)

If you want me to continue implementing, tell me which pages/screens (or node-ids) to implement first and provide any images/assets you want included.
